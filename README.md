# hermes
Hermes is Lab41's foray into recommender systems. It explores how to choose a recommender system for a new application by analyzing the performance of multiple recommender system algorithms on a variety of datasets.

It also explores how recommender systems may assist a software developer of data scientist find new data, tools, and computer programs.

The Wiki associated with this project has details on many [references](http://github.com/Lab41/hermes/wiki/References) that we utilized when implementing this framework. It also details the [datasets](http://github.com/Lab41/hermes/wiki/Datasets) used in this base framework, as well as some [resources](https://github.com/Lab41/hermes/wiki/Training-Materials) to help you get started in recommender systems and Spark.
